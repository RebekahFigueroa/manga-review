# Phase 4 Ruby Project for Flatiron

# Video Game Library and Rating App

This is an app that allows you to keep track of all of the video games you own and rate/ review them. Users can see other reviews/ ratings to see what players think of a game.

# Why

The primary goal is to have all of your video games in one place to easily remember what you own as well as track your experience with the game. Users can also see the overall rating of a game to make purchasing decisions. .
